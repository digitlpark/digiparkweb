# sigma algebra

If $\Omega$ is a given set, then a $\sigma-$algebra $\mathbb{F}$ on $\Omega$ is a family of subsets of $\Omega$ satisfying
$
- $\phi\in \mathbb{F}$
- $F\in \mathbb{F}\Rightarrow F^{C}\in \mathbb{F}$
- $A_{1},A_{2},...\in \mathbb{F}\Rightarrow \cup_{i}A_{i}\in \mathbb{F}$

> Measurable space: $(\Omega, \mathbb{F})$

# Probably measure

Defined on a measurable space $(\Omega,\mathbb{F})$

probability measure is a function P: $\mathbb{F}\rightarrow [0,1]$ such that

- $P(\phi)=0;P(\Omega)=1$
- For disjoint sets $A_{1},A_{2}...\in \mathbb{F}, P(\cup A_{i})=\sum\limits P(A_{i})$

> Probability space: $(\Omega,\mathbb{F},P)$

The subsets of $\Omega$ which belong to $\mathbb{F}$ are called $\mathbb{F}-$measurable sets

# smallest sig alg

Given a family U of subsets of $\Omega$, the smallest $\sigma$ algebra containing it

$$
H_{U}=\cap \{H;H\ \sigma \text{-algebra of }\Omega,U\subset H\}
$$

The one generated by open sets is called the Borel $\sigma$ algebra on $\Omega$ and its elements are called Borel sets.

# Lemma

If X,Y are functions $\Omega\rightarrow R^{n}$ then Y is $H_{X}$ measurable iff there exists a Borel measurable function g such that $Y=g(X)$

Let there be a complete probability $(\Omega, \mathbb{F},P)$

A random variable X is $\mathbb{F}$ measurable function $X:\Omega\rightarrow R^{n}$

$$
\begin{align*}
\mu_{X}(B)=P(X^{-1}(B))\\
E[X]=\int_{\Omega}X(w)dP(w)=\int_{R^{n}}xd\mu_{X}(x)\\
E[f(X)]=\int_{R^{n}}f(x)d \mu_{X}(x)
\end{align*}
$$

# independence

A collection of random variables {$X_{i}$} is independent if the collection of generated $\sigma$ algebras $H_{X}$ is independent
