1.  Prevention of wastage in any form whether it is solvent, energy, or any form. 
    
2.  Atom economy is defined as percentage mass of the desired product. According to green chemistry principles atom economy of any reaction should be made as much high as possible. 
    
3.   Use of methods which are less toxic and less hazardous. 
    
4.  Designing safer chemicals.  
    
5.  Use of safer solvents and non toxic reagents.  
    
6.  Methods should be designed for optimum energy efficiency. 
    
7.  Use of renewable feed stock. 
    
8.  Reduce the number of derivatives. 
    
9.  Use of reagents in catalytic amounts is much better than  use in stoichometric amounts. 
    
10.  Chemicals should be designed for easy degradation.  
    
11.  Real time analysis of pollution and its prevention should be performed.  
    
12.  Inherently safer chemistry should be followed to prevent any accidents.
