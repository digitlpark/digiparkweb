# Types of titration

## Titration of a weak acid with strong base

## Titration of a strong base with a weak and strong acid

## Titration of weak base with weak acid

Titration of weak acid with weak base is not possible and vice versa because there is no suitable indicator.  

It is not possible by any indicator because it doesn't have a steep/sharp edge and no indicator lies in that range.
