Elaborating how it [[Chemistry_s/Applied Chemistry/Water Treatment/Water#^743482|creates problems in boilers]]

# Sludge and Scale formation
On continuous evaporation on hard water in boilers, the salts present in it get saturated and are finally deposited in the areas where the flow is slow.
* Sludge: When these precipitates are loose and slimy in nature.
	* Can be removed by scrapping with a brush
	* Disadvantages
		* Poor heat conduction
		* Efficiency
		* Difficult to remove if trapped with a scale
		* Clogging
* Scale: When they are hard and they adhere strongly to the inner surface
	* Disadvantages
		* Poor heat transfer
		* Overheating of boiler and development of high pressure.
		* Clogging and low efficiency

# Removal and prevention
## Removal of Scales can be done by
1. Wooden scraper or wire brush.
2. Blowdown operation with "make up" water replating hard water with softened water.
3. Thermal shocks
4. Chemical treatment
## Prevention by Internal treatment
1. Colloidal conditioning
2. Addition of sodium phosphates
3. Carbonate conditioning
4. Calgon conditioning
5. Sodium aluminate conditioning
6. Electrical conditioning
7. Radioactive conditioning

# Caustic Embrittlement
Boiler failure due to the development of certain types of crack resulting from excessive stress.
Chemicals responsible: NaOH, silica
## Prevention
1. Sodium phosphate as softening agent instead of Na₂CO₃
2. Na₂SO₄/NaOH>2.5
3. Addition of organic agents
4. Crack resisting steels
# Corrosion
Occurs by chemical or electrochemical attack of the contents of water.
chemicals like:
1. Oxygen; Can be removed by
	1. Mechanical deaeration
	2. Chemical treatment
	3. Ion exchange techniques
3. Dissolved CO2: Can be removed by
	1. Mechanical deaeration
	2. Adding lime/NH3
	3. Heating
4. Mineral Acids

# Priming and Foaming
During rapid steam production, some liquid water drops are also carried along with the steam. This wet-steam formation is called priming.
Occurs due to:
* Dissolved solids
* High steam velocities
* Sudden boiling
* Sudden increase in steam production

Foaming is the production of bubbles and foams which do not break easily.
